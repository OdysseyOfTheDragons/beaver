My own mathematical OOP programming language.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Origin}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
It\textquotesingle{}s been years I dream about building my own programming language. But years passed, and nothing happened... until last year. For homework in my school, we had to do a simple {\ttfamily C} program to manipulate polynomials.

Interested, I dug a little bit further and built a working REPL from scratch, in order for the teacher to use the functionalities without looking at the code (well, he still had, of course, but he could at least play a little bit with it).

From that day onward, I read God knows how many websites, promising you to end the tutorial with a toy programming language. The thing is... I do not want to build a {\itshape toy} programming language, but a full-\/featured programming language, oriented towards polynomials manipulation. And what\textquotesingle{}s more, I don\textquotesingle{}t want to build a LISP (people in the same situation as me will understand what I mean).

So here is a project, that will most likely die in a few months like every other project I started, but well, maybe I will learn things during that short time...

The name, {\itshape beaver} comes from the fact that building a language takes time, and needs to be strong enough to resist waves. I think the name fits well with the way to build a language.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{The project}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The project will start small, and I hope it will grow bigger and bigger over time.

Here are the specifications\+:

\tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu}spread 0pt [c]{*{2}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
\cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ {\bfseries{Specification}}   }&\cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ Value    }\\\cline{1-2}
\endfirsthead
\hline
\endfoot
\hline
\cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ {\bfseries{Specification}}   }&\cellcolor{\tableheadbgcolor}\textbf{ Value    }\\\cline{1-2}
\endhead
{\bfseries{Language}}   &{\ttfamily C}, {\ttfamily OCaml}    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Type}}   &Interpreted, Compiled   \\\cline{1-2}
\end{longtabu}


Maybe some explanations are needed, no?

At school, we learn the {\ttfamily C} and {\ttfamily OCaml} programming languages. So my language will be built using ONLY these two languages. I think most of the code will be pure {\ttfamily C}, but I may want to use {\ttfamily OCaml} sometimes (even for a single function that would take less than 10 lines in {\ttfamily C}, and which would take 20 lines in {\ttfamily OCaml} with the interfacing to {\ttfamily C}. But hey, am I dumb or am I not?)

The language will be wholly interpreted, but there will be an option to compile\+: all the normally printed out strings will be stored, put in a dummy {\ttfamily C} program, and then compiled on the host machine. This is a trick, I know, but if it works, that\textquotesingle{}s what counts.

I will try to implement the basic functionalities with a good complexity, be it in time or in space.
